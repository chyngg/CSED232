I'm really enjoying graduate sc&ool.
professor and seniors are all good people.
I also go to vacation with people in the lab.
Th* vacation date$ are form 5.3 to 5.4 (Note that it is not weekend!)
I get paid well. I earn 415.9 dollars per week.
@fter paying tuition, I still have half my salary left over.
I hope you get into gr*duate school too.
